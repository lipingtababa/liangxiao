## Building the Artillery Force (1945-1948)

### Starting from Zero (September 1945)

**Initial deployment**: Zhu Rui and Political Commissar **邱创成** (Qiu Chuangcheng) led over **1,000 teachers and students** from the **Yan'an Artillery School** (延安炮兵学校) to Northeast China **empty-handed** (空手).

### Rapid Equipment Collection (By May 1946)

Collected abandoned Japanese and Nationalist equipment:
- **700+ artillery pieces**
- **500,000+ shells**
- **12 tanks**
- **2 armored vehicles**
- **23 automobiles**

**Zhu Rui's philosophy on urgency**:
"东北大乱，不能不乱，循规蹈矩，因噎废食，办不得大事。且资材遍地，先入为主，历史机时，稍纵即逝，不抓是不对的……不如此则无此后的胜利集中与团圆。"

(Northeast is in chaos, it must be chaotic. Following old rules and being overly cautious won't accomplish great things. Equipment is everywhere, first come first served. Historical moments are fleeting, not seizing them is wrong... Without this, there would be no later victorious concentration and reunion.)

### Organizational Structure Innovation

#### June 1946: Artillery Adjustment Office
- Established **炮兵调整处** (Artillery Adjustment Office) under Northeast Democratic Allied Army HQ
- Zhu Rui served as director
- Purpose: Coordinate artillery construction and adjustment

#### July 1946: "炮字第一号命令" (Artillery Command No. 1)

**Policy**: "广泛的普遍的发展与适当的集中使用" (Widespread universal development and appropriate centralized use)

**Structure**:
- Brigade/regiment level: Organize one artillery company, gradually expand to battalion
- Military region/column/division level: Expand artillery battalions to small regiment (two battalions)

#### October 19, 1946: First Artillery Command HQ Established

**"炮字第二号命令" (Artillery Command No. 2)**:
"为了更便利于组织、训练、指挥炮兵部队起见，决定在总司令部之下设立炮兵司令部（原炮兵调整处撤销），并任命朱瑞为司令员，邱创成为政治委员……"

**Historical significance**:
- **First Artillery Command HQ** in PLA history
- Artillery gained its own command, administrative, management, and education center
- Began forming as **independent military branch** (独立的兵种)

#### 1947: Further Organization

**Artillery Commands No. 3 and 4** issued, further adjusting and improving artillery organization

### Force Development Timeline

**By May 1946**:
- **10 artillery regiments** (炮兵团)
- **6 artillery battalions** (炮兵营)
- **1 anti-aircraft artillery battalion** (高射炮营)
- **1 tank unit** (坦克队)

**By August 1948**:
- **16 artillery regiments**
- **2 anti-aircraft artillery regiments**
- Dozens of division-level mountain artillery battalions
- **4,600+ artillery pieces** of various types
- **2,370 artillery pieces** at start of Liaoshen Campaign (another source)

**By End of 1948** (entering the pass):
- Approximately **9,000 artillery pieces** total

### Specialist Training and Deployment

**Military pledge**: Zhu Rui promised "三个月内，装备训练出四个炮兵团开赴前线打仗" (Within three months, equip and train four artillery regiments to deploy to frontlines)

**Specialist deployment**: Deployed **500+ officers of platoon rank and above** to military regions, military sub-districts, and main forces to:
- Assist in clearing and organizing artillery
- Form artillery battalions and regiments
- Artillery forces rapidly developed across Northeast units

**Philosophy**: Build specialist artillery units, don't try to train every infantry officer
- Artillery company/battalion/regiment commander requires very different skills than infantry commander
- Different organizational structures and coordination processes
- Better to build new specialized units than try to "empower" infantry to transform

## Death and Legacy

### October 1, 1948 - Death at Yixian

**Context**: After successful capture of Yixian

**What happened**: Zhu Rui left command post to personally inspect damage to city walls caused by artillery fire, to understand effectiveness of howitzer bombardment

**Fatal moment**: Stepped on landmine while en route from command post

**Age**: 43 years old

**Status**: Highest-ranking military commander to die during Chinese Civil War (解放战争中牺牲的我军最高将领)

### CCP Central Committee Condolence

"Comrade Zhu Rui made outstanding contributions to the construction of the People's Liberation Army's artillery. His sacrifice today is a great loss to the Chinese people's liberation cause."

(朱瑞同志对中国人民解放军炮兵建设作出了卓越贡献，他今天的牺牲是中国人民解放事业的重大损失。)

### Posthumous Honors

**October 3, 1948**: Central Military Commission approved naming Northeast Artillery School as **"朱瑞炮兵学校" (Zhu Rui Artillery School)**
- Now the PLA Army Academy

**Historical assessment**: If he had lived until 1955 military rank conferment, given his qualifications, achievements and position, he would have been strong candidate for **大将 (General)** rank

## Relationship with Lin Biao and Fourth Field Army

### Accepting Demotion to Build Artillery

Zhu Rui had been a prominent Eighth Route Army general, with folk legends comparing "Lin Biao's command at the Battle of Pingxingguan in the west, to Zhu Rui's leadership in breaking the iron encirclement in the east."

**Career choice**: Went to Northeast to work under Lin Biao's command, accepting position as head of artillery branch **despite this being a demotion**

**Achievement**: In just **two years** in harsh Northeast conditions, built an artillery force consisting of:
- Mountain artillery (山炮)
- Howitzers (榴弹炮)
- Soviet-style mortars (苏式迫击炮)
- Also became **PLA's first mechanized unit**

### Artillery's Role in Fourth Field Army Success

**Major campaigns**:
- Siege of Changchun (长春)
- Four Battles of Siping (四战四平)
- Liaoshen Campaign (辽沈战役) - particularly crucial role

**Organizational structure**: For large-scale offensive operations, established artillery column under Artillery Command that could centrally direct and manage artillery units. Infantry columns, divisions, regiments expanded their artillery regiments, battalions, companies.

## Key Themes for Article

### 1. Technology as Decisive Factor

**Artillery = "God of War" in WWII** (火炮在二战中被誉为"战争之神")

**Why artillery dominated in Chinese theater**:
- Tanks never formed large scale in Asian theater
- Aircraft only valuable in Pacific naval battles
- Artillery ultimately decided firepower

**Results speak for themselves**:
- From empty-handed (1945) to 9,000 pieces (1948)
- 10:1, 14:1, 16:1 fire superiority (from original materials)
- Battles won in hours instead of months

### 2. Organizational Innovation Over Individual Heroism

**Zhu Rui's approach**: Build specialist units (artillery companies → battalions → regiments → command HQ)

**NOT**: Try to "empower" every infantry officer to use artillery

**Reasoning**:
- Artillery commander vs infantry commander = completely different skill requirements
- Different organizational structures needed
- Different coordination processes

**Modern parallel**: Same as AI coding - build specialized AI coding units, don't try to train every developer

### 3. Historical Myth-Making Pattern

**Pattern**: Chinese traditional writers don't understand technology, don't want to talk about technology

**Result**: When writing biographies of successful figures, they consciously or unconsciously ignore technology's contribution

**Lin Biao mythology**: Stories emphasize his command artistry, make it dramatic and shareable, but lack practical learning value

**Truth**: Zhu Rui's story is closer to reality - PLA's overwhelming artillery superiority over Nationalists is a factor deliberately downplayed by propagandists

**Historical parallel**: Zeng Guofan mythology also ignores that Xiang Army's large-scale deployment of Western rifles gave obvious technology advantage on Chinese battlefield

### 4. Soviet Training and Knowledge Transfer

**Zhu Rui's value**: Soviet-trained specialist who:
- Introduced technology (artillery tactics, training methods)
- Pushed decision-makers to restructure organization
- Restructured combat processes
- Put artillery at central position in battle sequence

**NOT**: Spreading training to make every company commander use artillery (no "empowerment")

**Instead**: Directly organized professional artillery regiments, battalions, companies, made traditional infantry coordinate with specialized artillery units

### 5. Urgency and Historical Moment

**Zhu Rui's quote**: "历史机时，稍纵即逝，不抓是不对的" (Historical moments are fleeting, not seizing them is wrong)

**Actions**:
- Military pledge: 3 months to field 4 artillery regiments
- Sent 500+ officers to organize units across Northeast
- Built from 0 to 9,000 pieces in 3 years

---

## Additional Context from Original Materials

### Lin Biao as "CTO" Who Only Fights When 10x Advantage

**Pattern**:
- Jinggang Mountain adversity: Lin Biao asked "How long can red flag last?"
- Korean War adversity: Lin Biao claimed illness
- **Workplace veteran**: Only wins when absolute force superiority, can't/won't win when forces equal or at disadvantage

**Typical Lin Biao victories**: When troops absolutely superior

**Real factor**: Artillery superiority provided by Zhu Rui

### Artillery Examples from Original Materials

**December 1947 Zhangwu Battle**:
- PLA artillery **10x** Nationalist forces
- Completely destroyed enemy city defense system
- Annihilated defenders in **half a day**

**2 months later - Anshan Battle**:
- PLA artillery firepower **14x** Nationalist forces
- Only **one day** to destroy Nationalist fortified multi-layer defense positions
- Battle ended quickly

**Another month+ later - Fourth Battle of Siping**:
- PLA artillery firepower **16x** Nationalist forces
- Only **one day+** to liberate Siping, which both sides had fiercely contested multiple times

## Quotes to Use

### Zhu Rui's Philosophy

"东北大乱，不能不乱，循规蹈矩，因噎废食，办不得大事。且资材遍地，先入为主，历史机时，稍纵即逝，不抓是不对的……不如此则无此后的胜利集中与团圆。"

### Mao Zedong on Zhu Rui

"苏联有炮兵元帅，你就是中国的炮兵元帅！"

### Artillery Command No. 1 Policy

"广泛的普遍的发展与适当的集中使用"

### Lin Biao's Command Style (from original materials)

"刘亚楼，你记一下。我做如下部署调整。以4纵、11纵，加两个独立师强化塔山防线；2、3、7、8、9五个纵队，加6纵17师，包打锦州；10纵加1个师，在黑山、大虎山一线，阻击廖耀湘兵团；12纵加12个独立师，围困长春；5纵、6纵两个师，监视沈阳；1纵做总预备队。给我复述一遍。"

## Article Angle: Focus on Zhu Rui

**Core argument**: Fourth Field Army's success was not Lin Biao's command genius, but Zhu Rui's artillery technology and organizational innovation

**Supporting evidence**:
1. Concrete numbers: 10x, 14x, 16x fire superiority
2. Battle durations: Half day, 1 day, 23 hours (vs. months-long stalemates before)
3. Organization: Built from 0 to 9,000 pieces in 3 years
4. Specialist structure: Professional artillery units, not "empowered" infantry
5. Soviet training: Real technical expertise, not folk wisdom

**Pattern**: Technology + Organization > Individual Command Genius

**Modern parallel**: AI coding tools are the "artillery" of software engineering - build specialist units, don't try to train everyone

**Historical pattern**: Chinese writers ignore technology, overemphasize individual heroism (Lin Biao, Zeng Guofan same pattern)
