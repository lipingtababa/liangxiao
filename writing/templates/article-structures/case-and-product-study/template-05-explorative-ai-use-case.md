# Template 5: Explorative AI Use Case (探索性AI应用案例)

**Purpose**: For demonstrating real AI/engineering projects and their implications

**When to use**: When you've completed a real project combining software engineering and AI, and want to share the approach, results, and insights.

---

## Template Structure

### 1. Opening: Hook with the result
- Start with the surprising outcome (成本三块钱，时间几个小时)
- Immediately state this is NOT about being clever, but about approach
- Set up the contrast with expectations

**Example opening pattern:**
```
前两天我[做了X项目]，成本[具体数字]。

不是我[某种天赋/技能]好，是因为我把[问题]当成了一个[方法论]。
```

### 2. The Real and Valuable Problem
- State the problem clearly
- Show why it matters (cost, time, accessibility)
- Describe the status quo (traditional approach)
- Set up the contrast

**Key points:**
- Make the problem relatable
- Show the pain points
- Establish why current solutions are inadequate

### 3. The Explorative Approach (combining software engineering + AI)
Describe the approach step-by-step with these characteristics:

**Use accessible language but don't shy away from details:**
- Explain for non-software people
- But show enough detail for engineers to learn from
- Include real code snippets
- Include real conversations with AI
- Include real decisions and trade-offs

**Show the engineering process:**
- **Requirements Analysis**: What did you need to figure out?
- **Architecture & Development**: How did you design the pipeline?
- **Quality Review**: What problems did you find?
- **Iterative Fixes**: How did you solve them?
- **Output Design**: What did you produce?

**Format:**
- Use subheadings for each phase
- Include real code/conversation examples
- Show the human-AI collaboration

### 4. Calculate the Benefit
**Real numbers:**
- Cost (具体金额)
- Time (具体时间)
- Quality metrics
- Output formats

**Direct comparison to status quo:**
- Create a comparison table with multiple dimensions:
  * 思维方式 (Mindset)
  * 质量控制 (Quality control)
  * 改进方式 (Improvement approach)
  * 交付物 (Deliverables)
  * 可扩展性 (Scalability)

**Concrete example of reusability:**
- Show the second use case scenario
- Demonstrate cost/time savings from pipeline reuse
- Emphasize: "针对一类问题建立可复用的pipeline"

### 5. What's Not Solved & How to Refine
**Honest assessment of limitations:**
- Admit weaknesses naturally (e.g., "这是我最弱的一环")
- Be specific about what still needs work
- Don't oversell the solution

**What to cover:**
- Technical limitations discovered
- Areas where human expertise still matters
- Edge cases not yet handled
- How it could be improved
- What you would do differently next time

**Tone:**
- Self-aware and honest
- Not defensive
- Shows engineering maturity

### 6. The Bigger Insight
**Why this approach matters beyond this specific case:**
- What paradigm shift it represents
- What the industry doesn't understand
- The fundamental misunderstanding in the status quo

**Pattern:**
- Compare old paradigm vs new paradigm
- Use percentages or breakdowns to show the shift
- Example: "人的工作从'翻译'变成了'工程'"

**What the industry is missing:**
- List what traditional approaches lack
- Use bullet points
- Be direct and critical

### 7. Conclusion
**Summarize the key insight:**
- Restate what changed
- List the key roles/components needed
- Your results (cost, time, quality, reusability)

**End with:**
- A direct question to the industry ("你们准备好了吗？")
- Invitation to discuss/share workflow
- Engagement prompt for interested readers

## Key Characteristics of This Template

✅ **Shows actual work, not theory**
- Real project with real numbers
- Real code and conversations
- Real problems and solutions

✅ **Accessible to non-engineers, but with real technical details**
- Explain concepts clearly
- Don't hide complexity
- Balance accessibility with depth

✅ **Honest about limitations**
- Admit what you don't know
- Show what's not solved
- Demonstrate learning mindset

✅ **Emphasizes the approach/methodology over the result**
- Not "look how smart I am"
- But "here's an approach that works"
- Replicable and teachable

✅ **Demonstrates reusability and scalability**
- Show the pipeline is reusable
- For a category of problems
- Not a one-off hack

✅ **Combines storytelling with technical depth**
- Narrative flow through the project
- Technical details where they matter
- Human voice throughout

## Tone and Language Patterns

**Use these patterns:**
- "试举一例，..." (for examples)
- "这是**[Concept Name]**：..." (for defining concepts)
- "实际上，..." (for revealing reality)
- "换句话说，..." (for reframing)
- Natural admissions without formulaic phrases

**Avoid:**
- Boasting about results without showing process
- Hiding complexity or pretending it's easy
- Overselling the solution
- Ignoring limitations

## Section-by-Section Writing Approach

When writing with this template:

1. **Write Opening first** - Get the hook right
2. **Then Problem** - Make sure it's compelling
3. **Then Approach** - This is the meat, take time
4. **Then Benefits** - Numbers and comparison
5. **Then Limitations** - Be honest
6. **Then Insight** - Connect to bigger picture
7. **Finally Conclusion** - Tie it together

**Review after each section with human feedback before proceeding.**

## Example Article Using This Template

**Translation Engineering Article** (三块钱两个小时翻译一本书)
- Opening: $3, 315 pages translation result
- Problem: Translation is stuck in craft mode
- Approach: 5-phase engineering process (Requirements → Development → Review → Fix → Design)
- Benefits: Table comparing traditional vs engineering approach
- Limitations: "说实话，这是我最弱的一环" (design)
- Insight: Translation has become engineering, needs 5 roles
- Conclusion: "翻译公司，你们准备好了吗？"
