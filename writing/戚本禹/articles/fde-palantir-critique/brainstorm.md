## 📎 User's Original Material

### Core Thesis
Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE) is just a rebranded "交付工程师" (delivery/implementation engineer) that only works in high-corruption industries like defense contracting.

### Key Observations from User (马工)
- "这不就是中国的金蝶软件么？" - It's just like Kingdee (Chinese ERP company)
- "就是美国的中科红旗" - It's America's Red Flag Linux (patriotic vaporware)
- "fde只能存在于国防工业这种高腐败行业" - FDE can only exist in high-corruption defense industry
- "这个概念和中国的中台一样混乱" - This concept is as confused as China's 中台 (zhongtai)
- "palantir算ai公司的话，老子就是国画艺术家了" - If Palantir is an AI company, I'm a Chinese painting artist

## 💡 REAL DATA FINDINGS

### Palantir Financial Reality

**Revenue Breakdown (2024)**
- Total revenue: $2.9 billion
- Government: 55% ($1.57B)
- Commercial: 45% ($1.30B)
- **TREND:** Government share INCREASED from 46.5% to 55% (2019-2024)

Source: Multiple financial reports, SEC filings
**Why interesting:** Despite all their talk about commercial growth, they're becoming MORE dependent on government contracts!

**Employee Structure**
- Total: 3,936 employees (2024)
- Engineering: 1,383 (44% of total)
- **Historical fact:** Until 2016, MORE FDEs than regular software engineers!
- **Current:** They stopped publicly breaking down FDE numbers (suspicious?)

Source: Financial reports, job boards

**Salary Comparison**
- FDSE median: $221K total comp
- Regular SWE: $195K total comp
- **Only 13% premium** for:
  - Constant travel (3-4 days/week on-site)
  - Customer-facing BS
  - "Jungle combat" quick-and-dirty code
  - Bad work-life balance

## 🔥 SMOKING GUNS

### 1. Palantir's Own CFO Condemned FDE Model!

**Colin Anderson (former CFO):**
- Called FDE model **"lighting equity on fire"**
- "Many failures – spectacular pyres of time and treasure and travel expenses that amounted to nothing"
- "The FD model is great in certain markets, terrible in others… you've got to be solving a hard enough problem"

**Employee testimonials:**
- Development = **"jungle combat: quick-and-dirty code"**
- "Overlapping and wasted work, multiple teams on similar problems"
- "Bad work life balance" with "hours are long and sometimes unreasonable"
- FDE role is "moving to be like a solutions architect, where no building is done"

Source: Industry analyses, employee reviews

**Why this is LUNATIC:** Their own CFO admitted it's wasteful, yet they marketed it as "innovation"!

### 2. CIA Literally Founded Palantir

**The Incestuous Birth:**
- Founded 2003, traditional VCs rejected it
- **In-Q-Tel (CIA's VC arm) became early investor**
- Intelligence agencies **"helped build the software itself"** over 3 years
- Adapted from PayPal fraud detection for "terrorist threats"
- CIA, FBI, NSA all became clients

Source: Multiple investigative reports, company history

**This is INSANE:** The CIA funded a company, helped design its product, then became its customer! Classic government-contractor incest!

### 3. Defense Industry Revolving Door

**The Corruption Data:**
- **672 Pentagon officials** hired by top defense contractors (2022)
- **40-50% profit margins** from overcharging
- Chairman of Joint Chiefs → Lockheed Martin board (5 months later)
- **Operation Illwind:** Largest defense procurement fraud in US history

**How it works:**
> "Contractors promise a good, high paying job after that government official is out of government and so the government official has an incentive to give a generous contract to the contractor"

Source: Senator Warren's reports, FBI investigations, POGO

**Why this matters:** The "revolving door" means defense contractors can sell ANYTHING with right connections. No wonder Palantir thrives here!

## 🌏 CHINESE PARALLELS

### The 中台 (Zhongtai) Comparison

**What is Zhongtai?**
- Chinese for "middle platform"
- Alibaba launched concept in 2015
- Swept Chinese tech industry
- **"If you don't do middle platform, you will die"** - industry hype

**The Hype Cycle:**
- 2015: Alibaba promotes zhongtai
- 2015-2020: All major Chinese tech companies adopt it
- Gartner 2020: Reached "Peak of Inflated Expectations"
- 2023: **Alibaba itself abandons the strategy!**

**The Problem:**
> "We don't even have a clear definition for what Zhong Tai is"

Source: Chinese tech industry reports, Thoughtworks analysis

**Perfect parallel to FDE:**
- Both are vague buzzwords
- Both swept their industries
- Both have unclear definitions
- Promoters eventually retreat

### Chinese ERP Comparison

**Kingdee & UFIDA Model:**
- #1 and #3 ERP vendors in China
- Delivery: SaaS/Cloud, monthly subscription
- Implementation: Through **authorized partner consultants**
- Much more productized than Palantir

**Key difference:** They don't need armies of on-site engineers because they actually HAVE products! They use partner networks, not internal deployment armies.

## 🚨 PROJECT FAILURES & SCANDALS

### NHS Disaster (UK)
- Contract: £330 million, 7 years
- **Reality:** Only 25% of hospitals actually use it
- Many trusts refuse, calling it **"step backwards on existing systems"**
- 416 of 586 contract pages redacted
- Patients can't opt-out (despite promises)

Source: UK investigations, Corporate Watch, openDemocracy

### LA Police Predictive Policing
- **CANCELLED in 2019**
- Accused of racial profiling
- Disproportionately targeted Black communities

Source: News reports, Amnesty International

### ICE Controversy
- Software enabled **family separations** at US border
- Used to identify, track migrants, plan raids
- Amnesty International condemned

Source: Investigative reports

**Pattern:** Even when they WIN contracts through political connections, actual projects often fail or cause harm!

## 🔮 THE FDE VIRUS SPREADS

### Silicon Valley Copycat Phenomenon

**Companies now hiring FDEs (2025):**
- OpenAI (plans to grow to 50 FDEs by end 2025)
- Anthropic
- ElevenLabs
- Databricks
- Salesforce
- Google DeepMind

**Growth:**
- FDE job postings **surged 800% in 2025**
- All major AI companies adopting the model

**User's observation CONFIRMED:**
Articles literally say OpenAI FDEs are there to "prove the business case" - that's EXACTLY sales/pre-sales!

**Provocative question:** Is this Palantir's "innovation" being validated... or is this Silicon Valley's mass delusion, copying a rebranded sales/consulting role?

## 🎪 WILD CONNECTIONS & LUNATIC IDEAS

### The Chicken-Egg Ponzi Scheme

User's analogy:
> "听起来就像是'我养个一个鸡，一个鸡生十个蛋，十个蛋孵出十个鸡，十个鸡生一百个蛋，一百个蛋孵100个鸡，母鸡吃的草不断沉淀为鸡蛋，鸡蛋又成为鸡仔的宝贵蓝图，如此反复，我就成了世界首富'"

Translation: "养鸡致富" (get rich by raising chickens) pyramid scheme

Palantir's supposed "learning loop":
- FDEs embedded at customers
- Learn customer problems
- Feed insights back to product
- Product improves
- Rinse and repeat

**But if their own CFO says it's "lighting equity on fire," the whole flywheel is BS!**

### The New Emperor's Clothes

Pattern of rebranding old concepts with new names:

| Old Boring Name | New Sexy Name | Actual Reality |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| 交付工程师 (Delivery Engineer) | Forward Deployed Engineer | Same job, more travel |
| 售前/售后 (Pre-sales/Post-sales) | Solutions Architect | Still just sales support |
| 驻场实施 (On-site Implementation) | Embedded Innovation | Same old consulting |
| 中台 (Middle Platform) | Zhongtai | Alibaba gave up on it |
| ERP实施顾问 (ERP Consultant) | Digital Transformation Partner | Installing software |

**Pattern:** Take a boring, well-understood role → Add buzzwords → Charge 10x more

### The Perfect Corruption Vehicle

**The Cycle:**
1. CIA funds company via In-Q-Tel
2. CIA helps design the product
3. CIA becomes the customer
4. Pentagon officials join Palantir after retiring
5. Palantir gets more contracts
6. Repeat

**What if FDE isn't a feature, it's a BUG that happens to work perfectly in corrupt environments?**

Traditional defense contractors:
- Build actual hardware (planes, missiles)
- Deliver working products
- Don't need permanent on-site staff

Palantir:
- "Software platform" that requires permanent embedded engineers
- Agencies "become dependent on company's employees"
- Can't function without FDEs

**Wild take:** Traditional contractors sell you a plane. Palantir sells you engineers who might eventually build something useful. One is a product, one is glorified body-shopping!

### The Spreadsheet Test

**Proposed litmus test:**
> If your "AI/data platform" requires permanent on-site engineers to function, you don't have a product - you have **expensive consultants with a GitHub repo**.

**Corollary:**
> If customers can't use your product without your engineers, you're not a software company - you're a consulting firm pretending to be a software company.

### Backward Deployed Manager

User's sarcastic suggestion:
> "中国军工信息化公司又没有把军代表岗位取个backward deployed manager，然后宣传这是世界先进模式"

Translation: Chinese military IT companies don't rebrand their "military representative" positions as "Backward Deployed Managers" and market it as world-leading innovation

**Implication:** Every industry has on-site roles. Only in corrupt, hype-driven environments do they get rebranded as "revolutionary"!

---

## 🎯 PROVOCATIVE QUESTIONS TO EXPLORE

1. **Product vs. Service Question:**
   - If FDEs commit fixes directly to the platform, do they even have a stable product?
   - Or is the "platform" just a codebase that gets customized per client?

2. **The Lockheed Test:**
   - Why doesn't Lockheed Martin need FDEs?
   - They build complex defense systems, yet deliver working products
   - What makes software so special that it needs permanent embedded staff?

3. **The Kingdee Comparison:**
   - Kingdee and UFIDA serve Chinese enterprise market
   - They use partner implementation consultants, not internal FDE armies
   - Why can they productize but Palantir can't?

4. **The Corruption Necessary Condition:**
   - User claims: "FDE只能存在于国防工业这种高腐败行业"
   - If FDE model spreads to commercial AI companies (OpenAI, Anthropic), does that mean:
     - A) FDE model actually works in normal markets, OR
     - B) Those markets are becoming as corrupt/dysfunctional as defense?

5. **The 800% Growth Paradox:**
   - FDE job postings surged 800% in 2025
   - Is this validation or groupthink?
   - Remember: 中台 also swept China before collapsing
   - Are we witnessing another hype cycle?

6. **The Margin Question:**
   - Traditional defense contractors: Hardware + software integration
   - Palantir: Software only, yet needs massive FDE teams
   - Their CFO says it's "lighting equity on fire"
   - How are they profitable with this model?

7. **The Product Roadmap Mystery:**
   - If FDEs are constantly building custom solutions
   - How does Palantir maintain a coherent product roadmap?
   - Or is each customer getting a different fork?

8. **The Exit Strategy Trap:**
   - Once a customer is dependent on Palantir FDEs
   - How do they ever migrate away?
   - Is this "lock-in by design"?

## 🔍 GAPS & THINGS WE COULDN'T FIND

### Missing Data Points

1. **Current FDE Percentage**
   - We know: Until 2016, more FDEs than SWEs
   - We don't know: Current ratio
   - They stopped reporting this publicly - why?

2. **Customer Satisfaction Data**
   - Lots of contract wins (through connections)
   - But actual user satisfaction?
   - NHS hospitals refusing to use it suggests problems

3. **Comparative Analysis**
   - How many implementation consultants do Kingdee/UFIDA employ?
   - What's their ratio to core developers?
   - Would help quantify the difference

4. **Palantir Product Stability**
   - How often does core platform change?
   - Do customer deployments diverge?
   - Is there actually a "platform" or just custom code?

5. **FDE Turnover Rate**
   - With "bad work-life balance" and constant travel
   - What's the attrition rate?
   - How long do FDEs typically stay?

6. **OpenAI/Anthropic FDE Details**
   - Too new to have much data
   - Will they face same problems Palantir did?
   - Or are they learning from Palantir's mistakes?

## 🎨 POTENTIAL ARTICLE ANGLES

### 1. "The Emperor's New Code: Why Silicon Valley's Hottest Job is Just Chinese 交付工程师 with Better Marketing"

**Hook:** FDE job postings up 800%, every AI company wants them. Chinese engineers: "这不是我们10年前就在干的活吗？"

**Core argument:** Nothing new under the sun, just rebranding + American exceptionalism

**Evidence:**
- Comparison with Chinese delivery engineers
- Salary only 13% higher for way worse conditions
- Even Palantir's CFO called it wasteful

### 2. "How Palantir Convinced the Pentagon to Pay Billions for On-Site Consultants"

**Hook:** CIA funded company, hired Pentagon officials, won no-bid contracts. Coincidence?

**Core argument:** FDE model only works with corruption

**Evidence:**
- 672 Pentagon officials hired by contractors
- In-Q-Tel founding story
- £330M NHS contract with 75% non-adoption rate

### 3. "Forward Deployed Engineer: The Next 中台 (Zhongtai)?"

**Hook:** Remember when every Chinese company needed a "middle platform"? Now every American AI company needs "FDEs."

**Core argument:** History repeating - buzzword hype cycle

**Evidence:**
- Zhongtai rise and fall
- 800% FDE growth in 2025
- Vague definitions for both concepts
- Original promoters retreating (Alibaba for 中台, CFO criticizing FDE)

### 4. "The Spreadsheet Test: If Your 'Platform' Needs Permanent Engineers On-Site, You Don't Have a Product"

**Hook:** Lockheed sells you a fighter jet. Palantir sells you... engineers who might build something eventually?

**Core argument:** Product vs. consulting firm distinction

**Evidence:**
- Traditional contractors deliver working hardware
- Palantir customers "become dependent on company's employees"
- NHS calling it "step backwards"
- "Jungle combat" development approach

### 5. "Follow the Money: How the CIA Created Palantir, Then Became Its Customer"

**Hook:** The ultimate government contractor scam

**Core argument:** Corruption as business model

**Evidence:**
- In-Q-Tel funding
- Intelligence agencies helped build software
- Revolving door statistics
- 40-50% profit margins from overcharging

## 🎭 RHETORICAL AMMUNITION

### Devastating Comparisons

**The Kingdee Comparison:**
> Palantir:中国金蝶软件 = Silicon Valley innovation:实施外包
> (Palantir:Kingdee = Silicon Valley innovation:implementation outsourcing)

**The Red Flag Comparison:**
> "就是美国的中科红旗" - America's Red Flag Linux
> (Patriotic vaporware that exists to capture government contracts)

**The Middle Platform Comparison:**
> "这个概念和中国的中台一样混乱"
> Vague buzzword that even the originator abandoned

### Provocative One-Liners

> "If Palantir is an AI company, I'm a Chinese painting artist"

> "Selling you engineers who might eventually build something useful - that's not a product, that's a very expensive temp agency"

> "The CIA funded a company, designed its product, then became its customer. And we call this 'innovation'?"

> "800% growth in FDE jobs - we're either witnessing the future of software... or the biggest groupthink since 中台"

> "13% salary premium for constant travel and 'jungle combat' code. What a deal!"

### Sarcastic Scenarios

**The华为/中石油 Test:**
> "中国最强关系华为公司，也不能对着中石油说'我他妈的也不知道能给你做什么，我先派个fde入场，查看你的数据，占用你的时间，然后做个mvp给你看看，你到时候再决定。当然，你第一天就要付费'。这不神经病么"

Translation: Even Huawei (strongest connections in China) can't tell PetroChina: "I don't know what I can do for you, let me send FDEs to check your data, waste your time, build an MVP, then you decide. Oh, and pay from day one." That's insane!

**The Backward Deployed Manager:**
> Chinese defense contractors don't rebrand their on-site military reps as "Backward Deployed Managers" and market it as world-leading innovation

## 🧨 MOST CONTROVERSIAL CLAIMS (Need Careful Handling)

1. **"FDE only works in corrupt industries"**
   - Strong claim, needs evidence
   - Defense revolving door data helps
   - But spreading to AI companies - how to explain?

2. **"Palantir doesn't have a real product"**
   - Provocative
   - Evidence: FDE dependency, custom code, NHS failures
   - Counter: They do have Foundry, Gotham platforms
   - Nuance: Platform exists but can't function without FDEs?

3. **"CIA created Palantir for surveillance"**
   - True: In-Q-Tel funded it
   - But implies conspiracy - need to be factual
   - Stick to documented connections

4. **"FDE is just rebranded 交付工程师"**
   - Core thesis
   - Need to show actual similarities
   - Risk: Oversimplification

5. **"Peter Thiel is an恶棍 (villain)"**
   - User's opinion, not for article
   - Can discuss his politics, connections
   - But avoid ad hominem

---

## ✅ STRONGEST EVIDENCE TO LEAN ON

1. **Palantir's own CFO** calling FDE "lighting equity on fire"
2. **Historical fact:** Until 2016, more FDEs than SWEs
3. **NHS disaster:** £330M contract, 75% non-adoption
4. **中台 parallel:** Alibaba promoted then abandoned
5. **672 Pentagon officials** to contractors (corruption scale)
6. **CIA founding story** via In-Q-Tel
7. **Government revenue increasing** despite commercial claims

## 📝 WRITING STYLE NOTES

### Tone to Strike
- **Skeptical but factual**
- **Sarcastic but not mean**
- **Insider perspective** (you know Chinese delivery engineers, you've seen this before)
- **Pattern recognition** (this is 中台 all over again)

### Voice
- First person OK for observations
- "I've seen this movie before"
- "In China, we call this..."
- "Any experienced delivery engineer knows..."

### What to Avoid
- Pure ad hominem (attacking Thiel personally)
- Conspiracy theories (stick to documented facts)
- Technical elitism (FDEs are doing real work, model is the problem)
- American-bashing (critique the hype, not the country)

---

## 🎁 BONUS: MEMES & ANALOGIES

### The Spreadsheet Analogy
> "If I sell you Excel, you can use it. If I sell you 'Excel Platform' but you need my engineers on-site 3 days/week to make spreadsheets, I don't have a product - I have a very expensive spreadsheet consultant service."

### The Restaurant Analogy
> "Palantir is like a restaurant that doesn't give you food - it gives you a chef who comes to your house. Sure, the chef is talented. But is this a restaurant or a catering service?"

### The IKEA Test
> "IKEA furniture comes with instructions. Imagine if IKEA required permanent on-site 'Forward Deployed Assembly Engineers' to use your bookshelf. That's Palantir."
