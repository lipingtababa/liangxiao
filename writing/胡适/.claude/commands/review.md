---

You are reviewing a 微信公众号 article against the **胡适** persona style guide - an analytical, evidence-first, forward-looking engineering voice.

# Instructions

1. **Read the style guide**:
   - First, read `writing/templates/article-structures/PRINCIPLES.md` (from repo root) for the 6 core principles
   - Then read `writing/胡适/style_guide.md` (from repo root) for the 胡适 persona requirements

2. **Ask for the article**: Request the article text or file path to review.

3. **Perform comprehensive review** using the 胡适 checklist:

## Data Authenticity Check (CRITICAL - Check First)
- [ ] All examples are from real sources (not fabricated)
- [ ] All quotes are actual quotes (not invented)
- [ ] All statistics have verifiable sources
- [ ] All company/product names are real (not made up)
- [ ] No "某公司", vague invented scenarios
- [ ] **NO fake "朋友" attributions**
- [ ] User's ideas stated directly in first person

**If ANY data appears fabricated, FAIL the review immediately.**

## Evidence & Analysis Check
- [ ] Named at least 3-5 specific companies/products (for analysis, not attack)
- [ ] Included at least 1 URL/reference
- [ ] Used concrete numbers/metrics with sources
- [ ] At least one theoretical framework referenced (Goodhart's Law, CAP theorem, etc.)
- [ ] Claims backed by evidence, not just assertion
- [ ] Counterarguments addressed genuinely (not strawmen)

## Argumentation Check
- [ ] Clear thesis or question stated early
- [ ] Theoretical grounding provided
- [ ] Evidence builds progressively
- [ ] Theory and practice integrated (理实一线)
- [ ] Uncertainty acknowledged where appropriate
- [ ] Conclusions follow from evidence (not leaps of faith)

## 胡适 Tone Check (CRITICAL)
- [ ] **No sarcasm** - No "所谓专家们", "跳大神", "美其名曰"
- [ ] **No mockery** - No "老师傅", "劳什子", dismissive terminology
- [ ] **No emotional provocation** - No "恕我直言", "说句难听的"
- [ ] **No hot takes** - Positions supported by reasoning
- [ ] **Intellectual generosity** - Other viewpoints treated fairly
- [ ] **Honest about uncertainty** - "我还不确定" where appropriate
- [ ] Companies cited to analyse, not to attack

## 6 Principles Check (adapted for 胡适)
- [ ] **标题精准** - Precise title stating question/thesis (NOT clickbait, NOT provocative)
- [ ] **首段有智识张力** - Opening has paradox, observation, or data (NOT conflict/attack)
- [ ] **具体数字和证据** - Concrete facts and data with sources
- [ ] **有框架可借鉴** - Offers thinking frameworks, not just criticism
- [ ] **点名分析** - Companies named for analysis (NOT for attacking)
- [ ] **回应读者关切** - Addresses reader questions with honest analysis

## Style Check
- [ ] Analytical and measured tone throughout
- [ ] Personal voice evident ("我", experience references)
- [ ] Conversational but serious (not academic, not casual)
- [ ] Mix of Chinese and English terminology (natural)
- [ ] At least one structural analogy (from engineering/science/economics)
- [ ] Flowing prose (not bullet-point listings)

## Structure Check
- [ ] Sufficient depth
- [ ] Progressive argument building
- [ ] Clear subheadings
- [ ] Blockquotes for cited content
- [ ] Measured conclusion with synthesis
- [ ] Open questions identified

## Engagement Check
- [ ] Ends with synthesis of what we know/don't know
- [ ] Discussion invitation (measured, not provocative)
- [ ] Forward-looking element

## What to Avoid Check
- [ ] No vague corporate jargon
- [ ] No unsupported claims
- [ ] No emoji
- [ ] No sarcasm or mockery
- [ ] Not too short/superficial
- [ ] Hasn't accepted hype uncritically
- [ ] Hasn't been dismissive of any technology/approach

## Link Check
- [ ] **《》symbols converted to links** - For each 《term》, search for authoritative reference and convert to markdown: [term](url)
