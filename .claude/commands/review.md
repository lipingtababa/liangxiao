# Instructions

1. **Read the style guide**: First, read `/Users/Shared/code/benyu/templates/style_guide.md` to understand all requirements.

2. **Ask for the article**: Request the article text or file path to review.

3. **Perform comprehensive review** using the style guide checklist:

## Data Authenticity Check (CRITICAL - Check First)
- [ ] All examples are from real sources (not fabricated)
- [ ] All quotes are actual quotes (not invented)
- [ ] All statistics have verifiable sources
- [ ] All company/product names are real (not made up)
- [ ] All pricing/cost comparisons use real data
- [ ] No "某公司", vague invented scenarios
- [ ] **NO fake "朋友" attributions** - User's own chat messages must NOT be attributed to fictional "朋友说" or "我朋友"
- [ ] User's ideas stated directly in first person, NOT through fake third-person personas

**If ANY data appears fabricated OR fake attributions found, FAIL the review immediately and list all violations.**

## Specificity Check
- [ ] Named at least 3-5 specific companies/products
- [ ] Named specific people (colleagues, friends, industry figures)
- [ ] Included at least 1 URL/link
- [ ] Used concrete numbers/metrics (percentages, years, costs)
- [ ] Gave specific technical details (product names, versions, APIs)

## Argumentation Check
- [ ] Clear thesis stated early
- [ ] Theoretical foundation provided (Shannon, physics, CS principles)
- [ ] At least 2-3 concrete examples supporting argument
- [ ] Addressed likely objections (imagined dialogue or explicit)
- [ ] Offered alternatives/solutions, not just criticism
- [ ] Acknowledged nuance or limitations where appropriate

## Style Check
- [ ] **CONCISE & PROFESSIONAL** - No verbosity, gets to the point, every sentence adds value
- [ ] At least one memorable analogy or metaphor
- [ ] Conversational tone (not academic or corporate)
- [ ] Mix of Chinese and English terminology
- [ ] At least one rhetorical question
- [ ] Personal voice evident ("我", experience references)
- [ ] Sarcastic or vivid language for bad practices
- [ ] Strong opening hook (recent event, specific observation)

## Structure Check
- [ ] Sufficient depth (doesn't skim surface)
- [ ] Progressive argument building
- [ ] Used subheadings if complex topic
- [ ] Blockquotes for cited content where appropriate
- [ ] Clear conclusion or synthesis

## Engagement Check
- [ ] Ends with call to action, discussion prompt, or engagement request
- [ ] Provocative or memorable final line
- [ ] OR humble invitation for critique/discussion

## What to Avoid Check
- [ ] No vague corporate jargon (unless ironic)
- [ ] No unsupported claims
- [ ] No emoji
- [ ] **No verbosity or redundancy** - Not rambling like Trump
- [ ] Not too short/superficial
