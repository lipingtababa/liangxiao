  "body": "## \ud83d\udea8 Critical Bug Report\n\n### Description\nOur authentication system is rejecting secure passwords that contain special characters, forcing users to create weaker passwords. This is both a usability issue and a potential security vulnerability.\n\n### Problem Details\n- **Impact**: HIGH - Affects all users with secure passwords\n- **Security Risk**: Forces users to use less secure passwords\n- **User Experience**: Login failures cause user frustration\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. User creates account with secure password: `MySecure@Pass123!`\n2. User attempts to login with same password\n3. System shows error: \"Invalid password format\"\n4. User must change to weaker password to proceed\n\n### Expected Behavior\n- System should accept passwords with special characters: `!@#$%^&*()`\n- Authentication should work seamlessly\n- Security should be maintained or improved\n\n### Current Behavior\n- Password validation function rejects special characters\n- Users receive cryptic error messages\n- Secure passwords are not allowed\n\n### Technical Analysis\nThe issue appears to be in the `validate_password()` function:\n```python\ndef validate_password(password):\n    return password.isalnum()  # BUG: Rejects special characters!\n```\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Accept common special characters in passwords\n- [ ] Maintain existing security measures\n- [ ] Update validation logic with proper regex\n- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage\n- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility\n- [ ] Update error messages to be user-friendly\n\n### Additional Context\n- Affects ~40% of our user base who use password managers\n- Customer support tickets have increased 300% \n- Competitors allow special characters without issues\n- Security best practices recommend special characters\n\n### Priority: CRITICAL\nThis needs to be fixed immediately to prevent user churn and security degradation.",
