# Python/LangChain Multi-Agent System - Epic Overview

## Epic: Transform Single-Agent System to Multi-Agent Python/LangChain Architecture

### Problem Statement
The current TypeScript single-agent system is producing extremely poor quality code (as evidenced by PR #23 which deleted an entire README instead of removing a single phrase). We need a sophisticated multi-agent system with proper task decomposition, pair programming patterns, and quality gates.

### Solution Overview
Implement a Python/LangChain based multi-agent system where:
- Issues are broken down into specific tasks by a Project Manager agent
- Each task is executed by a specialized agent pair (Tasker + Navigator)
- Quality is ensured through iteration and review cycles
- The workflow is orchestrated using LangGraph state machines

## Risk Management

### High Priority Risks
1. **LangChain Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start simple, add features incrementally
   - Contingency: Fall back to direct OpenAI API if needed

2. **API Cost Explosion**
   - Mitigation: Token limits, caching, prompt optimization
   - Contingency: Daily spending limits, automatic shutoff

3. **Agent Hallucination**
   - Mitigation: Navigator validation, test execution, multiple checks
   - Contingency: Human review flag for suspicious changes

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **State Corruption**
   - Mitigation: LangGraph checkpointing, transaction boundaries
   - Contingency: State recovery from GitHub

2. **Performance Issues**
   - Mitigation: Profiling, caching, parallel execution
   - Contingency: Queue system for load management

3. **Integration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Incremental integration, comprehensive testing
   - Contingency: Modular design allows partial rollback

## Implementation Notes

### For AI Agents Implementing These Stories
1. **Always read existing code** before making changes
2. **Make targeted modifications**, never wholesale replacements
3. **Test your changes** before marking complete
4. **Follow the patterns** established in the codebase
5. **Ask for clarification** if requirements are unclear

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Incremental Development**: Each story builds on the previous
2. **Continuous Testing**: Every story includes test requirements
3. **Quality Gates**: Navigator review prevents bad code from progressing
4. **Clear Documentation**: Every component must be documented
5. **Monitoring First**: Observability built in from the start
