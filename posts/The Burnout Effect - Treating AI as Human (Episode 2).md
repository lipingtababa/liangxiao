# The Burnout Effect: Treating AI as Human (Episode 2)

Here's something that will mess with your head: AI gets tired.

Not physically tired, obviously. But when you overload Claude or GPT-4 with a massive document dump, something fascinating happens. It starts forgetting things. Making weird mistakes. Mixing up information from different parts of your prompt.

Sound familiar? It should. It's exactly what happens to you after reading documentation for six hours straight.

## The 3am Coder Syndrome

Last week, a fintech company called me in panic. Their shiny new AI system was supposed to analyze regulatory documents and flag compliance issues. They'd loaded entire 200-page PDFs into GPT-4's context window, confident in that "128k token capacity" marketing speak.

The AI did great with rules from the first 20 pages. By page 180? It was like talking to a developer at 3am who's been debugging since lunch. The AI literally forgot critical compliance rules it had "read" earlier.

Here's what they didn't understand: AI memory isn't like a database. It's more like... well, your memory after too much coffee and not enough sleep.

## Why Your AI Hallucinates API Methods

Another team I worked with had an even weirder problem. They loaded their AI coding assistant with documentation for React, Vue, Angular, and their internal framework. All at once. In one massive context.

The result? The AI started inventing methods that didn't exist. Not random garbage - plausible-sounding functions like `array.contains()` in JavaScript (that's Java, buddy) or `React.createComponent()` (nope, that's not a thing).

But here's the kicker: this is exactly what I did during my first all-nighter as a junior developer. After cramming multiple frameworks, I confidently wrote `$().getElementById()` - a horrible mashup of jQuery and vanilla JavaScript. My brain, overloaded and exhausted, had created a perfectly logical method that existed nowhere except in my sleep-deprived imagination.

The AI was doing the same thing. It wasn't broken. It was exhibiting the same "burnout" pattern we see in overworked humans.

## The Context Window Is Not a Hard Drive

Here's what everyone gets wrong about AI context windows:

**What people think:** "32k tokens = 32k tokens of perfect memory"

**Reality:** More like trying to juggle while someone keeps throwing you more balls. Sure, you can technically hold 7 balls. But can you juggle them all perfectly while someone shouts new instructions at you? Good luck.

I ran some tests. Here's what actually happens as you fill up an AI's context:
- First 1,000 tokens: Sharp as a tack
- 10,000 tokens: Starting to mix things up occasionally  
- 50,000 tokens: That friend who swears they're "totally fine" but keeps forgetting what they were saying
- 100,000 tokens: Full burnout mode - coherent but unreliable

## So What Do We Do About It?

Stop treating AI like a database with a query interface. Start treating it like a brilliant but limited colleague who needs good working conditions.

### For Document Analysis:
Instead of dumping entire documents, break them into overlapping chunks. Feed the AI one section, extract the key points, then feed it the next section along with the extracted points from before. It's like taking notes instead of trying to memorize everything in one go.

### For Coding:
Don't load all your documentation at once. Use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) - let the AI request specific docs when it needs them. Like a developer who knows when to check Stack Overflow instead of trying to memorize every API.

### The Redundancy Principle:
Important information should appear multiple times in different formats. Not because the AI is stupid, but because - like a tired human - it needs multiple touches to ensure critical information sticks.

## The Bigger Picture

This isn't a bug. It's telling us something profound about intelligence itself.

Maybe the ability to forget, to get confused, to blend concepts when overloaded - maybe that's not a weakness of intelligence. Maybe it's a fundamental feature. Perfect recall might actually be antithetical to the kind of pattern recognition and creative thinking we associate with intelligence.

When we built AI, we accidentally created something that exhibits the same cognitive limitations as humans. That should tell us something.

## The Practical Takeaway

Next time your AI starts hallucinating or forgetting things, don't assume it's broken. Ask yourself: "Would a human perform well under these conditions?"

If you wouldn't ask a developer to memorize 100 pages of documentation and then write perfect code, why are you expecting that from AI?

The future isn't about AI replacing humans or humans controlling AI. It's about understanding that we've created a new kind of intelligence that's neither human nor traditional software - and learning to work with its unique patterns of brilliance and burnout.
