# Brainstorm: AI Adoption Funnel (7-Level Journey)

## Original Funnel Model
```
1. 不愿意接触新事物
2. 接触新事物，然后说"这不就是我十五年前做的XYZ换个皮吗？"
3. 认识到新事物得不一样，但是"太麻烦了，还不如我古法方便"
4. 找到了不麻烦的方法，但是停留在问问chatgpt的程度
5. 收集各种秘诀，试图找个提升AI水平的葵花宝典
6. 发现没有葵花宝典，自己动手总结经验
7. 发表经验，接受挑战，不停的迭代经验
```

## 💡 Finding 1: ChatGPT Usage Patterns - The Three Activity Types

Source: [How People Use ChatGPT - OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/how-people-are-using-chatgpt/)

OpenAI identified three core usage categories:
- **Asking (49% of activity)**: Users seek information, advice, and factual answers
- **Doing (40% of activity)**: Task-oriented work including writing emails, coding, planning projects, and generating content
- **Expressing (11% of activity)**: Personal reflection, creative experiments, and exploratory conversations without specific goals

**Why this is interesting**: This maps to funnel levels 4-6. Level 4 (just asking ChatGPT) = "Asking". Level 6 (hands-on experimentation) = "Doing" + "Expressing". Most users stuck at level 4 are only using 49% of AI's potential.

**Provocative angle**: The funnel is actually about transitioning from **passive consumption** (Asking) to **active production** (Doing/Expressing).

## 💡 Finding 2: Rapid Adoption But Shallow Engagement

Source: [The Rapid Adoption of Generative AI - NBER](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w32966/w32966.pdf)

- Half of workers have used ChatGPT
- Younger, less experienced, higher-achieving, and especially **male workers** leading the curve
- Demographic gaps closing rapidly
- Among those who use genAI for work: 34% used it every workday, 52% used it some days, 14% didn't use it at all the previous week

**Why this is interesting**: Fast adoption doesn't mean deep mastery. Many people are stuck at levels 1-3 or 4. The funnel isn't about "have you tried AI" but "how deeply have you integrated it."

**Provocative question**: Is the real funnel not about technology adoption, but about **identity transformation**? (From "I use AI sometimes" to "I'm someone who learns in public")

---

## 💡 Finding 3: The Productivity Paradox - AI Doesn't Automatically Make You Productive

Sources:
- [AI Productivity Paradox - MIT Media Lab](https://www.faros.ai/blog/ai-software-engineering)
- [AI hampered productivity - Fortune](https://fortune.com/article/does-ai-increase-workplace-productivity-experiment-software-developers-task-took-longer/)
- [AI-Generated "Workslop" - HBR](https://hbr.org/2025/09/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity)

**Shocking statistics**:
- 95% of organizations see **no measurable ROI** on AI investments
- 85% saved 1-7 hours/week, but 37% lost to **rework** (correcting errors, rewriting, verifying)
- Software developers predicted 24% time savings, but actually took **19% LONGER**
- 77% of employees report AI **increased workload** and **decreased productivity**

**The "Workslop" problem**: AI produces content that appears polished but lacks substance, offloading cognitive labor onto coworkers.

**Why this maps to the funnel**:
- Level 4 users think they're productive but are creating "workslop"
- Level 5 users realize something's wrong, seek "secrets"
- Level 6 users figure out: **it's not about the tool, it's about the workflow redesign**

**Provocative insight**: The real barrier between level 4 and level 6 is **admitting the AI output isn't good enough**. People at level 4 are in denial about the quality of their AI-assisted work.

---

## 💡 Finding 4: Dunning-Kruger Effect - Level 2 Overconfidence

Sources:
- [Dunning-Kruger in Software Development - Medium](https://medium.com/@macbook.47/overconfidence-in-code-the-dunning-kruger-effect-in-software-development-4da27b49c172)
- [Dunning-Kruger Effect - Built In](https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/dunning-kruger-effect)

**Core insight**: People with superficial understanding overestimate their competence. In tech, this manifests as:
- "This is just like [old technology] with a new wrapper" (Level 2)
- Believing code is bulletproof when riddled with bugs
- Skipping code reviews due to overconfidence

**Why this matters**:
- Level 2 is a **trap** - people think they understand AI because they pattern-match to old tech
- The Dunning-Kruger curve shows confidence DROPS as you gain real knowledge (this is levels 3-5)
- Level 6-7 is when confidence rises again, but it's **earned confidence** based on experience

**Provocative angle**: Level 2 ("这不就是十五年前的XYZ换个皮吗？") is the **most dangerous level** because it prevents learning. People here are immune to evidence that contradicts their pattern-matching.

---

## 💡 Finding 5: "Not Invented Here" Syndrome - Why Level 2-3 Resist

Sources:
- [How NIH Kills Innovation - WunderGraph](https://wundergraph.com/blog/how-not-invented-here-kills-innovation-and-five-rules-to-avoid-it)
- [Not Invented Here - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here)
- [NIH Syndrome Explained - Learnosity](https://learnosity.com/edtech-blog/not-invented-here-syndrome-explained/)

**Definition**: Cognitive bias that leads individuals to reject/undervalue external ideas in favor of internally developed solutions.

**Resistance patterns in tech**:
- "We already tried that" (thought-terminating cliché)
- "We can do it better ourselves"
- Team identity built on "we can build anything" - outsourcing feels like an attack

**Psychological mechanisms**:
- **Confirmation bias**: Favor information confirming pre-existing beliefs
- **Groupthink**: Prioritizing consensus over critical thinking
- **Pride and ownership**: Attachment to one's own ideas

**Why this maps to funnel levels 2-3**:
- Level 2: "This is just XYZ rebranded" = NIH dismissal through pattern-matching
- Level 3: "Too麻烦, old method is better" = NIH comfort with existing solutions

**Provocative insight**: The transition from level 3 to level 4 requires **ego death** - admitting that your "ancient methods" might actually be inferior. This is why so few people progress past level 3.

---

## 💡 Finding 6: The "Secret Techniques" Trap - Why Level 5 Exists

Sources:
- [Prompt Engineering Guide 2025 - Lakera](https://www.lakera.ai/blog/prompt-engineering-guide)
- [Prompt Engineering Best Practices 2025](https://www.news.aakashg.com/p/prompt-engineering)
- [Complete Prompt Engineering Guide - DataUnboxed](https://www.dataunboxed.io/blog/the-complete-guide-to-prompt-engineering-15-essential-techniques-for-2025)

**Industry reality**: Prompt engineering has become an **industry unto itself**:
- Businesses investing in proper prompt engineering see **60-70% efficiency gains**
- The field now spans "formatting techniques to reasoning scaffolds, role assignments, and even adversarial exploits"
- Effective prompting "feels closer to programming than simple writing"

**Why level 5 is a trap**:
- The abundance of "ultimate guides," "complete guides," "secret techniques" creates the illusion that mastery = collecting more tips
- Reality: **Context-specific application** matters more than technique collection
- Companies see gains not from techniques themselves, but from **systematic experimentation** with their specific workflows

**Provocative angle**: The "葵花宝典" (secret manual) mentality is **cargo cult thinking** - copying the form without understanding the function. Level 5 people collect prompt engineering tricks like Pokémon cards.

**The real insight**: There IS value in prompt engineering knowledge, but only if you **iterate and adapt** it to your context (which requires moving to level 6).

---

## 💡 Finding 7: "Learning in Public" - Why Level 7 is the True Mastery

Sources:
- [Learn In Public - swyx](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public)
- [How to Learn in Public - DEV Community](https://dev.to/blackgirlbytes/how-to-learn-in-public-1coh)

**Core concept**: Shawn Wang popularized "learn in public" - sharing your learnings on the internet as you go.

**Key principles**:
- Create "learning exhaust" through blogs, tutorials, cheatsheets
- 80% of developers are "dark" (don't write/speak/participate)
- **Teaching amplifies mentors**: "By teaching you, mentors teach many"
- Not about expertise - it's "honest and open documentation of progress from beginner to advanced"

**Why this maps to level 7**:
- "发表经验，接受挑战，不停的迭代经验" is literally the "learn in public" framework
- Receiving challenges = getting feedback from the community
- Continuous iteration = incorporating feedback into improved understanding

**Career impact**:
- Builds visible portfolio of knowledge
- Attracts mentorship from experienced practitioners
- The pandemic accelerated this trend (remote work → more learning in public)

**Provocative insight**: Level 7 isn't about "teaching others" as charity - it's **selfish mastery**. By teaching publicly, you:
1. Force yourself to crystallize vague understanding
2. Receive corrections from experts (accelerated learning)
3. Build reputation (career opportunities)
4. Create accountability (public commitment to improve)

---

## 💡 Finding 8: The Feynman Technique - Why Level 6→7 is Critical

Sources:
- [Feynman Technique - Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/)
- [Feynman Technique - University of York](https://subjectguides.york.ac.uk/study-revision/feynman-technique)
- [Feynman Technique - Oxford Learning](https://oxfordlearning.com/the-feynman-technique-study-skills-secret-weapon/)

**Four-step process**:
1. Study the concept
2. **Teach it simply** (as if to a sixth-grader)
3. **Identify gaps** - things you can't explain simply reveal your gaps
4. **Review and simplify** - refine until you can explain simply AND accurately

**Why it works**:
- "The more you teach a subject, the better you grasp it"
- Teaching forces you to identify where you're using jargon to **mask lack of understanding**
- If you can't explain simply, **you don't truly understand it**

**Why this validates the funnel's level 7**:
- Level 6 = self-experimentation (step 1-2 of Feynman)
- Level 7 = public teaching + iteration (steps 3-4 repeated publicly)
- The gap identification (step 3) REQUIRES external feedback, which only happens by going public

**Provocative angle**: Most people THINK they understand AI because they can use it (level 4-5). But if you can't **teach it clearly** (level 7), you don't actually understand it. Level 7 is the **litmus test** for true mastery.

## 💡 Finding 9: Growth Mindset and Feedback Loops

Sources:
- [Carol Dweck Revisits Growth Mindset - EdWeek](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/opinion-carol-dweck-revisits-the-growth-mindset/2015/09)
- [Growth Mindset Summary - Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/carol-dweck-mindset/)
- [The Paradox of Carol Dweck's Mindset - Medium](https://medium.com/the-silent-script/the-paradox-of-carol-dwecks-mindset-when-growth-becomes-fixation-9acaf670def7)

**Core concepts**:
- **Growth mindset**: Belief that capacities can be developed over time
- **Fixed mindset**: Belief that capacities are inherent and unchangeable
- Students with growth mindset **outperform** those with fixed mindset

**Feedback loop mechanics**:
- Growth mindset = seeing feedback as **opportunity to learn**
- Students need **positive reinforcement + constructive feedback** to improve
- Must try **new strategies** and **seek input** when stuck - not just effort

**Critical insight from recent research**:
- Growth mindset can create "potentially endless feedback loops with no exit conditions"
- Need **recursive feedback loops** that allow for self-evaluation of when to pivot vs. persist

**Mapping to the funnel**:
- Level 1-3: **Fixed mindset** about AI ("it's just a fad," "old methods are better")
- Level 4-5: **Transitional** - trying AI but not seeking feedback
- Level 6: **Growth mindset** activated - self-experimentation with internal feedback
- Level 7: **Recursive growth mindset** - public feedback + iteration + self-evaluation

**Provocative question**: Is the funnel really about AI adoption, or is it about **developing growth mindset** in a new domain?

## 💡 Finding 10: Adoption Curve Reality - Most Organizations Stuck at Bottom

Sources:
- [ChatGPT Adoption Curve - Worklytics](https://www.worklytics.co/blog/chatgpt-adoption-curve-what-it-is-how-to-use-it)
- [Rogers Adoption Curve - Agility Portal](https://agilityportal.io/blog/rogers-adoption-curve)

**Rogers Adoption Curve in AI context**:
- **Innovators (2-3%)**: Level 6-7 (experimenting, sharing learnings)
- **Early Adopters (13.5%)**: Level 4-5 (using AI daily, seeking best practices)
- **Early Majority (34%)**: Level 2-3 (tried it, skeptical, sticking with old methods)
- **Late Majority (34%)**: Level 1 (resistant, waiting for proof)
- **Laggards (16%)**: Level 1 (actively rejecting)

**Why this matters**:
- Only **15-20%** of users reach levels 6-7 (Innovators + portion of Early Adopters)
- **68%** are stuck at levels 1-3 (Early Majority + Late Majority + Laggards)
- The funnel represents the **psychological journey** from Laggard to Innovator

**Provocative insight**: The funnel ISN'T about time (early vs. late adopters) - it's about **mindset progression**. You can be an "early adopter" chronologically but stuck at level 2-3 mentally ("this is just IRC with autocomplete").

---

## 🤔 Provocative Questions to Explore

1. **What if the funnel is actually a filter, not a ladder?**
   - Maybe only certain personality types can reach level 6-7
   - Is level 7 really necessary for everyone, or just for knowledge workers who need continuous learning?

2. **What's the most dangerous level?**
   - I'd argue level 2: Dunning-Kruger + NIH syndrome = immune to learning
   - Or level 5: Cargo cult thinking - collecting tips without understanding

3. **Can you skip levels?**
   - Some people go straight from level 1 to level 6 (curious mindset)
   - Others get permanently stuck at level 3 (comfort zone)

4. **What if "learning in public" (level 7) isn't the goal, but a side effect?**
   - Maybe the real goal is "teaching yourself" (Feynman technique)
   - Public sharing just happens to be the most efficient feedback mechanism

5. **Is this funnel specific to AI, or universal for any paradigm shift?**
   - Same pattern for: blockchain, cloud computing, microservices, remote work
   - What makes AI different? (Answer: Lower barrier to entry → more people at level 4-5)

6. **What percentage of ChatGPT's 100M weekly active users are at each level?**
   - Hypothesis: 10% level 1, 20% level 2-3, 50% level 4, 15% level 5, 4% level 6, 1% level 7
   - This would match Rogers curve + productivity paradox data

7. **Why do companies fail at AI despite individual adoption?**
   - Individuals at level 4-5 create "workslop"
   - Organizations stuck at level 3 (workflow redesign too麻烦)
   - Need organizational-level progression through the funnel, not just individual

8. **What causes the transition between levels?**
   - 1→2: Peer pressure (FOMO)
   - 2→3: Undeniable evidence (someone you respect succeeds with AI)
   - 3→4: Convenience breakthrough (Claude Code makes it easy)
   - 4→5: Frustration with mediocre results
   - 5→6: Realization that there's no shortcut
   - 6→7: Desire to solidify learning + build reputation

## 📊 Data Gaps (What I Couldn't Find)

1. **Demographic breakdown of funnel levels** - Which types of professionals reach level 6-7?
2. **Time to progress** - How long does it take to go from level 4 to level 6?
3. **Success patterns** - What triggers successful level transitions?
4. **Failure patterns** - What causes people to regress (e.g., level 5→3)?
5. **Cultural differences** - Does the funnel look different in China vs. US vs. Europe?
6. **Domain differences** - Do developers progress faster than non-technical knowledge workers?

---

## 🎨 Wild Ideas / Lunatic Takes

1. **The funnel is actually a mirror of technical seniority progression**
   - Junior dev = level 1-3 (resistant, pattern-matching, comfort zone)
   - Mid dev = level 4-5 (using tools, seeking best practices)
   - Senior dev = level 6-7 (experimenting, teaching)
   - **Wild conclusion**: AI adoption speed = proxy for how fast you COULD become senior

2. **Level 4 is the "tutorial hell" of AI**
   - In programming, "tutorial hell" = endlessly consuming tutorials without building anything
   - Level 4 = endlessly asking ChatGPT without building a systematic practice
   - Escape route: Same as programming - **build something from scratch**

3. **The funnel reverses for AGI**
   - Current funnel assumes human must learn to work with AI
   - Post-AGI: AI learns to work with human's style (no funnel needed)
   - **Provocative**: Are we teaching people to climb a funnel that will be obsolete in 5 years?

4. **Level 7 people are performing "meta-learning"**
   - They're not just learning AI, they're learning **how to learn**
   - This is the real competitive advantage - not AI mastery, but **learning agility**
   - When next paradigm shift comes, level 7 people will climb the new funnel 10x faster

5. **The funnel is toxic for certain professions**
   - Doctors, lawyers, therapists shouldn't be at level 7 (public learning risks credibility)
   - Maybe they need a different funnel: 1-6 same, but level 7 = "private communities of practice"
   - **Question**: Is "learning in public" a privilege of tech workers?

---

## 💬 Potential User Experiences to Explore

*Note: These are hypothetical - would need REAL user data to use in article*

- **The level 2 CTO**: 15 years experience, dismisses AI as "autocomplete," blocks team from using it
- **The level 4 product manager**: Uses ChatGPT for everything, outputs look good but lack depth, team notices
- **The level 5 consultant**: Has 50 "prompt engineering" bookmarks, still can't solve real client problems
- **The level 6 developer**: Spent 2 weeks building custom Claude Code integration, 3x productivity boost
- **The level 7 teacher**: Blogs about AI workflow, receives correction from expert, implements it, updates blog

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT fabricate these examples. Either use real data or ask user for real experiences.

## 🔥 NEW PROVOCATIVE FINDINGS - "Trigger and Anger" Angles

### Finding 11: The "Boiling Frog" - AI Job Displacement Reality (2025)

Sources:
- [AI职业危机 - 蚕食人类权力 - Sina Tech](https://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/csj/2025-02-21/doc-inemfmwh3708915.shtml)

- [中国AI崛起 - VOA](https://www.voachinese.com/a/china-ai-developments-sending-shock-waves-through-job-market/7979608.html)

**The Silent Career Massacre**:
- **8-year UI designer**: Team reduced from 15 to 3 people within **3 months** after AI tools introduced
- **Contract lawyer**: Charged ¥3,000 per review, lost **80% of clients in 3 months** after AI legal assistants (¥50/review) emerged
- **Tech founder**: Only realized company had **6 months runway** left after years of being "boiled frog" as revenue declined

**The Statistics That Should Terrify You**:
- IMF estimates **40% of global jobs** will be affected by AI
- World Economic Forum: 40% of business leaders plan to **reduce employees** in AI-automatable areas by 2025-2030
- China youth unemployment (16-24): **15.7%** in December 2024, with 12.22 million graduates in 2025
- Klarna's AI customer service = work of **700 full-time employees**; company reducing from 5,000 to 2,000 staff

**The Denial Patterns**:
- "AI is just a catalyst, not employment terminator"
- "AI can't replace human judgment, care, aesthetics"
- "Only 17,000 US jobs lost to AI between May 2023-Sept 2024 - just local fluctuation"
- **The greatest fear is complacency and refusing to abandon the inertia of self-deception, choosing to perish instead**

**Why this triggers anger**:
- **Level 1-3 people are literally being "boiled alive"** while telling themselves everything is fine
- The "温水煮青蛙" (boiling frog) metaphor is REAL - gradual job displacement happening NOW
- Every day you stay at level 1-3, you're one day closer to being replaced
- The UI designer didn't see it coming because she was comfortable with "ancient methods"
- The lawyer dismissed AI as "can't do my job" until 80% of clients left

**Provocative angle for article**:
**"你正在被温水煮，却还在争论水温是否真的在升高"**
(You're being boiled alive, yet still debating whether the water is actually getting warmer)

### Finding 12: Comfort Zone = Career Death

Sources:
- [Comfort Zone Career Stagnation - Anneme Coetzee](https://annemecoetzee.com/2024/05/30/the-comfort-zone-a-business-owners-best-friend-or-worst-enemy/)
- [How to Get Out of Comfort Zone - Medium](https://medium.com/@jobwanderer/how-to-get-out-of-your-comfort-zone-for-career-development-e253ac5a8928)
- [Career Stagnation - Employee of the Year](https://employeeoftheyear.africa/taking-risks-for-career-growth-when-and-how-to-step-out-of-your-comfort-zone/)

**The Brutal Truth**:
- Staying in comfort zone = **stagnation and lack of innovation**
- Companies hesitant to adopt new tech **"even if they could significantly improve efficiency"**
- In fast-paced tech change, **"remaining comfortable = falling behind"**
- Avoiding learning and new technology = **keeping workers in comfort zone** = career death
- **True career growth begins when we push past boundaries and embrace discomfort**

**Mapping to funnel**:
- **Level 3 ("太麻烦了，还不如我古法方便")** = comfort zone rationalization
- This is the TRAP - you THINK you're being rational ("my method works fine")
- Reality: Your method works fine TODAY, but becomes obsolete TOMORROW
- Level 3 is where careers go to die

**Why this triggers anger**:
- You're not being "practical" by sticking with old methods - you're being **lazy and scared**
- "Ancient methods are more convenient" is just **ego protection** - admitting AI is better = admitting you need to learn
- Every person at level 3 is trading short-term comfort for long-term career suicide
- The UI designer (team cut from 15 to 3) was at level 3 - she chose convenience over survival

**Provocative angle for article**:
**"'古法更方便'是职业生涯最昂贵的自我安慰"**
("'Old methods are more convenient' is the most expensive self-comfort in your career")

### Finding 13: AI Job Replacement - The Denial vs. Reality Gap

Sources:
- [AI替代工作 - CSDN](https://blog.csdn.net/l01011_/article/details/156793582)
- [DeepSeek爆火 被AI抛弃的人 - Sina Finance](https://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/roll/2025-02-11/doc-inekanhm6807379.shtml)
- [裁员or赋能 - 观察者网](https://www.guancha.cn/economy/2025_11_11_796566.shtml)

**The Two Narratives**:

**Optimistic narrative** (what level 1-3 people tell themselves):
- "AI can't replace human perception, care, judgment, aesthetics"
- "AI is catalyst for transformation, not employment terminator"
- "170M jobs created vs 92M eliminated = net +78M jobs"
- "Less than 17,000 US jobs lost to AI - not a crisis"

**Reality** (what's actually happening):
- **Musk predicts mass unemployment by 2030**, most jobs replaced by AI
- **Youth unemployment crisis** - China 15.7%, millions of graduates competing
- **Real companies, real layoffs** - Klarna replacing 700 employees with AI, cutting from 5,000 to 2,000
- **Real professionals losing livelihoods** - 80% client loss in 3 months for lawyer

**The Psychological Defense Mechanisms**:
- **Level 1**: "AI is a fad, will pass" (head in sand)
- **Level 2**: "This is just autocomplete, not real AI" (minimization through pattern-matching)
- **Level 3**: "My job requires human touch, AI can't do it" (exceptionalism)

**Why all three are forms of DENIAL**:
- They're psychologically protecting against the anxiety of "I might become obsolete"
- But denial doesn't stop job displacement - it just means you won't be prepared when it happens
- The lawyer probably told himself "AI can't do legal work requiring judgment" - until clients left

**Why this triggers anger**:
- **You're lying to yourself and you know it**
- Deep down, level 1-3 people KNOW AI is a threat, but admitting it = admitting vulnerability
- The "AI can't replace my job" narrative is **emotional self-protection**, not rational analysis
- Every day in denial = another day NOT preparing for inevitable change

**Provocative angle for article**:
**"你说'AI取代不了我的工作'时，心跳有没有加快？那是你的身体在告诉你：你在说谎"**
("When you say 'AI can't replace my job,' does your heart beat faster? That's your body telling you: you're lying")

## 🔥 ANGER-INDUCING PROVOCATIONS (Structured by Funnel Level)

### Attack on Level 1: "不愿意接触新事物"
**Provocative statement**:
"You're not 'being cautious' or 'waiting for things to mature.' You're a coward hiding from change."

**Evidence to make them angry**:
- While you wait, 50% of workers have already tried ChatGPT
- The UI designer who "waited to see how things develop" lost her job when team cut from 15 to 3
- **By the time you're "ready," the safe jobs will already be taken by level 6-7 people**
- You're not being prudent; you're being the frog in the pot watching the water heat up

**Trigger mechanism**: Call out the rationalization as cowardice

---

### Attack on Level 2: "这不就是十五年前的XYZ换个皮吗？"
**Provocative statement**:
"Your 15 years of experience has made you STUPID, not wise. You're so trapped in pattern-matching that you can't see what's actually new."

**Evidence to make them angry**:
- This is textbook **Dunning-Kruger effect** - your surface-level understanding makes you overconfident
- You're committing **"Not Invented Here" syndrome** - dismissing external innovations because of ego
- The lawyer who said "AI legal work is just template filling" lost 80% of clients
- **Your pattern-matching is a BUG, not a FEATURE**

**Trigger mechanism**: Attack their pride in experience

---

### Attack on Level 3: "太麻烦了，还不如我古法方便"
**Provocative statement**:
"'Ancient methods are more convenient' is the most expensive lie you tell yourself. You're choosing short-term comfort over career survival."

**Evidence to make them angry**:
- **Comfort zone = career death** in fast-changing fields
- Companies that say "new tech is too麻烦" are the ones that die
- The frog doesn't jump out of the pot because it's "too麻烦" - and then it dies
- **Every day you choose convenience is a day closer to being replaced**
- You're not being practical - you're being lazy and scared to admit you need to learn

**Trigger mechanism**: Expose the comfort zone as cowardice

---

### Attack on Level 4: "停留在问问chatgpt的程度"
**Provocative statement**:
"You THINK you're productive with AI, but you're actually creating 'workslop' - polished garbage that your coworkers have to fix."

**Evidence to make them angry**:
- 77% of employees report AI **increased their workload** (because of people like you)
- 85% save 1-7 hours/week, but **37% lost to rework** fixing AI mistakes
- Developers using AI took **19% LONGER** to complete tasks
- **You're the problem** - you're offloading cognitive labor onto your team
- You think you're at 100% productivity, but you're only using 49% of AI's potential (just "Asking")

**Trigger mechanism**: Expose their false sense of competence

---

### Attack on Level 5: "试图找个提升AI水平的葵花宝典"
**Provocative statement**:
"Collecting prompt engineering tips is CARGO CULT THINKING. You're cosplaying as someone who understands AI."

**Evidence to make them angry**:
- You have 50 bookmarks to "ultimate guides" but still can't solve real problems
- You're like someone collecting Pokémon cards and calling it strategy
- **Prompt engineering tips are useless without context-specific experimentation**
- Companies get 60-70% gains from SYSTEMATIC EXPERIMENTATION, not from reading guides
- **You're mistaking the map for the territory**

**Trigger mechanism**: Expose the technique-collecting as fake mastery

---

### Attack on Level 6-7: (No attack - these are the winners)
**Validation statement**:
"You've figured it out. Level 1-5 people are arguing whether the water is warm. You've already jumped out of the pot and are teaching others how to do the same."

---

## 🎯 REFINED Article Angles (Anger-Inducing)

### **RECOMMENDED ANGLE: "你正在被温水煮死"**
### ("You're Being Boiled Alive")

**Structure**:
1. **Opening shock**: Real stories of job displacement (UI designer, lawyer, founder)
2. **The 7-level denial-to-mastery funnel**: Frame as "stages of denial before acceptance"
3. **Attack each level**: Use provocations above to expose rationalizations
4. **The brutal truth**: Only level 6-7 survive; level 1-5 are frogs in the pot
5. **Call to action**: Jump out of the pot NOW, or die with your "ancient methods"

**Why this triggers anger**:
- **Attacks identity and ego** at each level
- Uses **real job loss data** to create urgency
- **Exposes rationalizations** as lies people tell themselves
- Makes readers **uncomfortable with their current level**
- Creates **FOMO and survival anxiety**

**Target audience**: Level 2-4 (majority of people, most in denial)

**Tone**: Confrontational, brutal honesty, no sugar-coating

---

### Alternative Angle: "AI时代的七层地狱：你在第几层？"
### ("The Seven Circles of Hell in the AI Era: Which One Are You In?")

Dante's Inferno metaphor - each level is a deeper circle of career hell, with level 1 being the outermost (least damned) and level 5 being the deepest hell (worst delusion). Levels 6-7 are escaping hell into purgatory/paradise.

**Why this works**: Cultural metaphor of "hell" creates visceral reaction

## 🎬 Next Steps

1. **Confirm provocative angle with user** - Is "你正在被温水煮死" the right attack level?
2. **Identify user's real experiences** - Which level were you at? What triggered your progression?
3. **Choose target audience level** - Attack level 2-3 most? Or level 4-5?
4. **Create outline** - Structure the "boiling frog" narrative
5. **Draft article** - Use real data, real provocations, no sugar-coating
