LIVE DEMO: PR #23 Disaster Prevention System

This demonstrates how the SyntheticCodingTeam prevents disasters like PR #23
where an AI agent deleted an entire README when asked to remove one phrase.

The revolutionary TaskPair system prevents this through Navigator reviews.

A revolutionary multi-agent system for automated code development.

## Features

- Multi-agent collaboration with PM, Developer, Analyst, Tester agents
- Revolutionary TaskPair system with Navigator reviews
- Disaster prevention through pair programming patterns
- Real Git integration and workspace management

## Architecture

The system uses LangGraph workflows to orchestrate multiple AI agents:

1. **PM Agent**: Analyzes issues and creates task breakdowns
2. **Developer Agent**: Implements code solutions
3. **Analyst Agent**: Analyzes requirements and constraints
4. **Tester Agent**: Creates comprehensive test suites
5. **Navigator Agent**: Reviews all work for quality and safety

解释文化细节 - This phrase needs to be removed

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Configure API keys in `.env`
3. Run the system: `python main.py`

## Why This Prevents Disasters

The Navigator agent reviews EVERY change before approval:
- Catches destructive operations
- Ensures requirements are met
- Maintains code quality standards
- Prevents data loss through multiple safety checks

This system would have prevented PR #23!
