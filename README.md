⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Understand the 'Write Once, Publish Everywhere' tool requirements
     ☐ Research platform APIs (WeChat/Weixin, RedNote)
     ☐ Create project brief for the tool
     ☐ Analyze technical feasibility and architecture

⏺ Excellent idea! A "Write Once, Publish Everywhere" (WOPE) tool would be incredibly valuable for content creators. Let me help you explore this concept thoroughly.

  I'd like to understand your vision better. Here are some key questions to help shape this project:

  1. Content & Platforms:
  - Besides WeChat (Weixin) and RedNote, are there other platforms you'd like to include? (e.g., LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Medium, personal blog?)
  - What type of content will you primarily publish? (articles, blog posts, technical documentation, marketing content?)

  2. Writing Environment:
  - What format would you prefer to write in? (Markdown, plain text, rich text editor?)
  - Do you want a dedicated writing app or integration with existing tools (VS Code, Obsidian, etc.)?

  3. Publishing Features:
  - Should the tool handle platform-specific formatting automatically?
  - Do you need scheduling capabilities (publish at specific times)?
  - Should it manage media/images across platforms?
  - Do you want to track publishing status and analytics?

  4. Technical Preferences:
  - Any preferred programming language or framework?
  - Desktop app, web app, or command-line tool?
  - Local storage or cloud-based?

  Would you like me to:
  1. Create a detailed project brief to document all requirements
  2. Research the APIs for WeChat and RedNote publishing capabilities
  3. Brainstorm features and architecture options
  4. Analyze similar tools in the market

  Please share your thoughts on the questions above, and let me know which next step appeals to you!

> Yes, linkedin should be there. Also my personal blog magong.se should be supported through vercel.
  main contents would be articles.
  I would prefer md. it should handle platform specific format in the future, but let us forget about it for this moment.
  it should manage images, for sure. In fact, I would like it to help me find or generate images.
  No tracking needed. use python. web. local sotage.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Understand the 'Write Once, Publish Everywhere' tool requirements
     ☐ Research platform APIs (WeChat/Weixin, RedNote, LinkedIn, Vercel)
     ☐ Create project brief for the tool
     ☐ Analyze technical feasibility and architecture
     ☐ Design image management and generation features

⏺ Perfect! I have a clear picture now. Let me quickly outline what I understand:

  Your WOPE Tool Requirements:
  - Platforms: WeChat, RedNote, LinkedIn, magong.se (via Vercel)
  - Content: Articles written in Markdown
  - Tech Stack: Python web app with local storage
  - Special Feature: Image management + generation assistance

  Let me research the publishing capabilities for each platform:

  Platform Publishing Methods:
  1. LinkedIn - Has official API for sharing content
  2. WeChat/Weixin - Official Accounts have APIs, personal accounts are trickier
  3. RedNote (小红书) - No official API, may need web automation
  4. magong.se (Vercel) - Can use Git push or Vercel API

  Key Architectural Considerations:
  - Frontend: Web UI for writing/managing articles
  - Backend: Python (Flask/FastAPI) for API integration
  - Storage: Local SQLite for articles, metadata, and publishing status
  - Image Handling: Local storage + AI generation integration

  Would you like me to:

  1. Create a detailed project brief documenting the full scope and technical architecture
  2. Start with a technical proof-of-concept for one platform (I'd suggest LinkedIn or Vercel first)
  3. Design the article management system with Markdown editor and image features
  4. Research specific API limitations and workarounds for each platform

  Which approach would help you move forward most effectively?

  architectures that balance technical excellence with real-world constraints.

  Type *help to see my available commands, or let's continue discussing your Write Once, Publish Everywhere tool architecture!

  Based on Mary's analysis, I see you're building a Python web app that publishes Markdown articles to WeChat, RedNote, LinkedIn, and your personal blog (magong.se via Vercel), with
  image management capabilities.

  Would you like me to:
  1. Design the full-stack architecture for this system
  2. Focus on the API integration architecture
  3. Plan the data model and storage strategy
  4. Design the image management pipeline

  What aspect of the architecture would you like to explore first?

⏺ Excellent choice! Let me design a comprehensive API integration architecture for your WOPE tool.

  API Integration Architecture Design

  Core Architecture Pattern: Publisher Adapter Pattern

  # Abstract Publisher Interface
  class Publisher(ABC):
      @abstractmethod
      async def publish(self, article: Article) -> PublishResult:
          pass

      @abstractmethod
      async def validate_credentials(self) -> bool:
          pass

      @abstractmethod
      def transform_content(self, article: Article) -> dict:
          pass

  Platform-Specific Implementation Strategy

  1. LinkedIn Publisher
  # Uses official API
  class LinkedInPublisher(Publisher):
      - OAuth 2.0 authentication
      - REST API for sharing
      - Supports text + images
      - Rate limits: 100 requests/day

  2. Vercel/Blog Publisher
  # Git-based or API deployment
  class VercelPublisher(Publisher):
      - Option A: Git push to repo
      - Option B: Vercel Deploy API
      - Markdown → Blog format
      - Image asset management

  3. WeChat Publisher
  # Official Account API or Automation
  class WeChatPublisher(Publisher):
      - Official Account: REST API
      - Personal: Selenium/Playwright
      - Content adaptation needed
      - Image upload handling

  4. RedNote Publisher
  # Web automation required
  class RedNotePublisher(Publisher):
      - Playwright automation
      - Session management
      - Anti-bot strategies
      - Image optimization

  Key Architectural Components

  1. Credential Manager
  class CredentialVault:
      - Encrypted local storage
      - Per-platform credentials
      - Token refresh logic
      - Secure key derivation

  2. Content Transformer
  class ContentAdapter:
      - Markdown → Platform format
      - Image processing pipeline
      - Length/format constraints
      - Hashtag/mention handling

  3. Publishing Orchestrator
  class PublishingEngine:
      - Parallel publishing
      - Retry mechanisms
      - Status tracking
      - Error aggregation

  API Integration Flow

  [Article] → [Orchestrator] → [Platform Publishers]
      ↓                              ↓
  [Images] → [Image Manager] → [CDN/Upload]
      ↓                              ↓
  [Transform] → [Validate] → [Publish] → [Result]

  Authentication Strategies

  1. LinkedIn: OAuth 2.0 with refresh tokens
  2. Vercel: API tokens or Git SSH keys
  3. WeChat: AppID/Secret or session cookies
  4. RedNote: Session persistence with 2FA support

  Error Handling & Resilience

  class PublishingStrategy:
      - Exponential backoff
      - Platform-specific retry limits
      - Partial failure handling
      - Rollback capabilities

  Would you like me to:
  1. Deep dive into any specific platform integration
  2. Create detailed API endpoint mappings
  3. Design the authentication flow implementation
  4. Build a proof-of-concept for one platform

  Which would be most helpful for your next steps?

      """
      TEST_API_BASE = "https://api.weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin"
      SANDBOX_BASE = "https://mp.weixin.qq.com/debug"

  Key Considerations

  1. IP Whitelist: Must configure server IPs in Official Account settings
  2. Content Review: Articles may undergo automatic/manual review
  3. User Segmentation: Can target specific user groups
  4. Analytics: Track reads, shares, likes via stats API
  5. Menu Integration: Can add articles to account menu

  Would you like me to:
  1. Create a complete WeChat publisher implementation
  2. Design the image processing pipeline for WeChat
  3. Build content formatting templates
  4. Explain the account verification process

  Which aspect would be most valuable for your implementation?
